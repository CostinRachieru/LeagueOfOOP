	Second stage of the project:

		For adding the angels, the strategies for heroes and the Grand Magician I chose to use
	the Factory pattern for the the angels, the Strategy pattern for strategies and the 
	Observer pattern for the Grand Magician.

	    Angels
	    Each angel modifies a parameter in the Hero class, or call a method that does a designated
	task (like revive a hero, or kill it). The Spawner angel revives a hero who was killed in it's
	cell. For that i had to modify my program so that the hero doesn t leave the map after being
	killed.

		Strategies
		I made a Strategy interface with to methods(that modifies the Healthpoints and the strategy
	bonus) that are implemented by each strategy for each type of hero. Each hero chose it's
	strategy at the beginning of each round.

		Observer
		The Grand Magician is made out of many observers who are monitoring different aspects of the
	game.

        I wrote the code this way, so that it is scalable and easy to add new features to it.
