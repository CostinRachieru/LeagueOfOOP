	    I chose to use two factories, one for the types of heroes, and one for the types of Cell
	(for further improvements). The interactions between the heroes are made with DoubleDispatch.
	The map of the game is a SingleTone. The reading is done using the FileIO.jar file methods.

	    The main features of the game are implemented in the GameEngine class: the initialisation
	of the map and players, the movement and the combat of the players. The readability is improved
	by the large number of methods implemented in final classes.

	    The Map is formed by Cells generated for each type of terrain and stored in an
	ArrayList<ArrayList<Cell>>. These cells also store the players in them (can store any number
	of players) and update the land modifier of the heroes. These also check if there is a combat
	to be fought.

        	In the Hero class are implemented methods common for all heroes, like the ones used for
    	leveling up system, the death, the movement and how they are getting damaged. In the
	subclasses of the Hero class is implemented a DoubleDispatch so that the heroes can interact
	with each other. In each subclass there are methods that implement abilities and the mechanism
    	these affect other heroes. Mainly, each ability has a method that returns its damage without
    	the race modifier applied (so that the methods can be used by the wizard to compute its
    	damages).

        I wrote the code this way, so that it is scalable and easy to add new features to it.
